# Front-end Style Guide

## Layout

The responsiveness were created with '@media queries' and I made 7 break points with the following maximum widths:

- Default view orientation
- Desktop: 1440px
- Laptop: 1024px
- Tablet: 768px
- Tablet: 582px
- Mobile Large: 426px
- Mobile Medium: 375px

> ðŸ’¡ These are just the design sizes. Ensure content is responsive and meets WCAG requirements by testing the full range of screen sizes from 320px to large screens.

## Colour references

* --clr-light: hsl(0, 0%, 100%)
* --clr-darklight: hsl(212, 45%, 89%)
* --clr-lightblue: hsl(216, 15%, 48%)
* --clr-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%)

## Typography

### Body fonts
* Font size (paragraph): It's your discretion
* <h2> (default size)

### Font

- Family: [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit)
- Weights: I used as it is

> ðŸ’Ž This is a free+ challenge. So, if you want to see all the design details and practice working with professional tools like Figma, you can download the design file from where you downloaded the starter code.
